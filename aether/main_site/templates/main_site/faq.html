            So what is this about ?

            This is a website for a gaming guild called Ã†ther. We are involved in several games, eg.
            World of Warcraft, Guild Wars 2, World of Tanks, Minecraft, etc.
            On WoW, we can be found on server Magtheridon-EU, faction Alliance.

            Okay, so what kind of guild are you, then ?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            We are a relatively small, established, social and friendly gaming guild. We spend our time in several games,
            depending on what we happen to feel like doing. Currently we are spending time with the Warlords of Draenor expansion.

            Who's your guild leader ? Do you have any officers ?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Well, technically yes. However, nobody seems to care anymore. Mostly we just talk things over
            with the group, so I guess you could call us a democracy :)

            Democracy, eh? So how is it working for you ?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Surprisingly well, actually. We are still clearing raids and doing stuff
            as a guild, so i guess that says something ? :P

            So, can I join?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Eh, maybe ? Write an application on our public forums, and we'll talk about it :)
